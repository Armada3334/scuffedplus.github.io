    <div class="text">
      <p> gottta keep atleast 2 of these a month, missed october though.</p>
      <p> feeling much better lately to be honest, worked through alot of issues recently.</p>
      <p> another thing! started playing TF2 again, having more fun with it than any other games recently.</p>
      <p> ditching twitter, and i may reformat some pages, but hopefully i will draw some more soon. </p>
      <p> think i have been kind of depressed recently, but i feel like that may be passing holiday season and all, maybe.</p>
      <p> odd thing is, i feel like i come out a better person  whenever im all low, hope thats true.</p>
      <p> anyway, thanks for reading, even if you are a year or two after i write this. ;)</p>
