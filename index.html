                <p>i'm an electronics hobbyist and artist.</p>
                <p>im into computers, videogames, headphones, vr, keyboards, and otherwise like tinkering with electronics.</p>
                <p>i like pc hardware and find just about anything else with a semiconductor in it interesting.</p>
                <p>i also like drawing, and have a gallery hosted on this site; newer or better work is higher.</p>
                <p>most social media is kinda stupid, i only really browse it, if you want to talk, just add my discord or telegram.</p>
                <p>furry art is cool, i do it. i also do other illustration and graphic design.</p>
                <p>i'm up to play most games, but i end up playing VR games or source engine stuff cause modern games are overwhelmingly mediocre.</p>
                <p>i'll also sometimes just kinda hyperfixate on certain things or games some of the time, it's fun.</p>
                <p>i'm also into warhammer 40k, talk to me about lore or minis some time.</p>
