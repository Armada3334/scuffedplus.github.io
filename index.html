                <p>im currently 15 years old, and i have adhd.</p>
                <p>im ace/arospec, so i'm not gonna date or boink ya.</p>
                <p>im overall sorta indiferent towards sex, though i do find guys and enbys attractive.</p>
                <P>my timezone is gmt -8, or PST if you'd like to know how bad my sleep schedule is.</P>
                <p>other than that, i don't really care to share more personal information publicly.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-content sub-text">
                <p>i'm an electronics hobbyist and artist.</p>
                <p>im into computers, videogames, audio, vr, keyboards, and otherwise like tinkering with electronics.</p>
                <p>i like pc hardware and find just about anything else with a semiconductor in it interesting.</p>
                <p>i also like drawing, and have a gallery hosted on this site; newer work is higher.</p>
                <p>most social media is kinda wacky, i only really use it to post some art, not to talk much, just add my discord.</p>
                <p>furry art is cool, i do that primarily alongside some graphic design stuff.</p>
                <p>i play mainly vr games or TF2, because modern games are overwhelmingly mediocre in my opinion</p>
                <p>as a small footnote, i really like warhammer lore, talk to me about it.</p>
