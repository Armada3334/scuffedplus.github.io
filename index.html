                <p>i'm an electronics hobbyist and artist.</p>
                <p>im into computers, videogames, audio, vr, keyboards, and otherwise like tinkering with electronics.</p>
                <p>i like pc hardware and find just about anything else with a semiconductor in it interesting.</p>
                <p>i also like drawing, and have a gallery hosted on this site; newer or better work is higher.</p>
                <p>most social media is kinda stupid, i'll only really browse it or post art, if you want to talk, just add my discord or telegram.</p>
                <p>furry art is cool, i do it. i also do other illustration and graphic design.</p>
                <p>i'm up to play most games, but i end up playing VR games or source engine stuff cause modern games are overwhelmingly mediocre.</p>
                <p>i'll also sometimes just kinda hyperfixate on certain things or games.</p>
                <p>as a small footnote, i really like warhammer, talk to me about it.</p>
