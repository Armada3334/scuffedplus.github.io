                <p>to get some basics out of the way, i go by they/them and am nonbinary. i'm 15, and ill go by either sean or scuffed.</p>
                 <p>i have adhd and some other associated mental issues, but i manage fine. i'm creative and generally approachable most of the time.</p>
                  <p>other than that i don't really care to share more personal information, so don't ask unless i know you, please. </p>

                <p>i'm a big fan of electronics. i am into computers, vr, headphones and art, and i do some software stuff on the side as well. </p>
                <p>i could probably help with most tech issues, but im more of a hardware person. i just prefer physical stuff, to be honest.
                i still customize the hell out of my OS, don't get me wrong though, i just don't understand what im doing as well there.
                hardware on the other hand, i could rattle off tech specs of my gear for a while, i'm better at troubleshooting that side of the coin. 
                i like tinkering with low voltage stuff, cause it can't kill me, right? i like building computers, and will always poke around my devices to see how they work.</p>
                <p>VR now, i'm also an enthusiast on this side. i have had a headset since 2018, and don't intend to ditch mine any time soon.
                i'm not ecstatic about the way vr is heading, but meta is better than no one, and market growth is always welcome. 
                it's interesting to me, all the gimmick stuff that comes with an emerging market, and i hope to pioneer some of my own ideas as well.</p>
                <p>headphones, yay! but seriously, i like hifi audio, and yes i can hear the difference. not for everyone, but i like it.</p>
                <p>software stuff, im a novice at best im learning. i do mainly web dev stuff if anything, as you see currently. i want to learn some python, and will soon, probably.</p>
                <p>art, and furry stuff i guess. i have doodled for as long as i can remember, but i have been more serious with a display tablet and all since mid 2021. 
                the furry stuff comes with it, i like the art, and decided to draw some. my fursona's refsheet is embedded below this.</p>
