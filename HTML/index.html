            <p>im currently 15 years old, and i have adhd.</p>
            <P>my timezone is gmt -8 if you'd like to know how bad my sleep schedule is.</P>
            <p>other than that, i don't really care to share more personal information, so don't ask unless i know you, please.</p>

        <div class="collapsible-content sub-text">
            <p>i'm an electronics hobbyist and artist.</p>
            <p>im into computers, videogames, audio, vr, keyboards, and otherwise like tinkering with electronics.</p>
            <p>i like pc hardware and find just about anything else with a semiconductor in it interesting.</p>
            <p>i also like drawing, and have a gallery hosted on this site; newer work is higher.</p>
            <p>most social media is kinda wacky, i only really use it to post some art, not to talk much, just add my discord.</p>
            <p>furry art is cool, i do that primarily alongside some graphic design stuff.</p>
            <p>i play mainly vr games or TF2, because modern games are overwhelmingly mediocre in my opinion</p>
            <p>as a very small footnote, i really like warhammer lore, talk to me about it.</p>
