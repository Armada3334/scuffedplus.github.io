                <p>art is my hobby, and i do commissions for some income and practice.</p>
                <p>im willing to experiment and try new things.</p>
                <p>commissions aren't a job to me, so please don't treat them as such.</p>
                <p>pricing and timeframe may vary depending on desired the piece.</p>
                <p>if you would like art from me, you agree to everything written below.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-content sub-text">
                <p>obligatory TOS stuff</p>
                <p>my art cant be used in any ai dataset or resold.</p>
                <p>my art should be credited when used and my signature should not be removed.</p>
                <p>you need to disclose if my art will be used for commercially and i retain rights to my work.</p>
                <p>my work isnt to be used for any hateful or bigoted cause.</p>
                <p>pricing is very fluid, and comes down to the difficulty and interest of the piece.</p>
                <p>i'd prefer to just, talk about vision and decide from there.</p>
                <p>communication is handled through discord, my tag is listed on the homepage.</p>

                <p>now, enough of the formal stuff.</p>
                <p>i am open to draw just about anything, though i reserve the right to deny any request.</p>
                <p>i have more experience with furry art, and thus am better with anthro characters.</p>
                <p>any gnc or queer characters are a plus, and im open to have fun with a design.</p>
                <p>my timeline isn't concrete, and the maximum time from the begginning of a commission would be around a month.</p>
                <p>i can accept several edits to sketches or wip stages for free.</p>
                <p>although edits to the final piece may require payment for major changes unless i made a mistake.</p>
                <p>i'd like to keep open communication and send updates whenever requested.</p>
                <p>contact me through discord to speak further, my discord tag is listed on my homepage.</p>
