              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so, just as my winter break from school ends, a site revamp courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/ToastBuster">my friend</a> is pushed to live.</p>
              <p>the layout is better, and it has extravegant features like mobile support, and some cool color changes.</p>
              <p>the rest of my break has been good if mundane, cause my family doesn't celebrate christmas or anything.</p>
              <p>LA has been getting some serious rain aswell, don't remember the last time it rained this hard for this long here.</p>
              <p>the cooler weather it brings is nice, but it also causes leaks, which kinda suck.</p>
              <p>other than that everything is good, unless school sucks or lightning strikes and kills my PC.</p>
              <p>again, thanks for caring enough to read these, and i wish you well!</p>
