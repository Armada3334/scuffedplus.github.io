            <div class="blog-body">
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing too heavy again here, not much really stressful going on for me recently.</p>
              <p>finals were surprisingly easy, and i'm on a nice long winter break until mid january!</p>
              <p>free time also gives plenty of time for self reflection, and blog posts i guess.</p>
              <p>i've never been able to keep a paper journal, but a digital one like this helps keep some record.</p>
              <p>beyond the more personal stuff; i rewrote my bio again, can't wait to do it again in 2 months.</p>
              <p>i also got myself a gmmk pro with box kailh brown switches, sounds great and now i have a silly pink keyboard!</p>
              <p>overall, december has been great for me, hope its the same for you, and happy holidays!</p>
