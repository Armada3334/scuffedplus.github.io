              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over the past day or two, i have migrated and essentially remade my website on a github host as opposed to neocities. the random delays on pushing revisions and medeocore code editor just got to me. </p>
              <p> i got a bit carried away with my 'revision' and ended up essentially rewriting everything to a less amateur standard, and up to modern best practice for some things like image embeds. i hope to atleast, keep this site updated for a long time, if not making more major upgrades. for some reason i was using tables array images, and had some weird brown and orange motif going on before, but i modernized the design language atleast. </p>
              <p> im a fan of both flat modern-ey design and skeuomorphism, but i think im gonna stick with a more clean look for my bio page and everything else here, unless i make a gag retro page. in that case, word art and gradients are free game.</p>
              <p> now, onto the second part of the title, unfortunately im a bit under the weather, as they say. thankfully it't not covid, but that negative test didn't clear up my conjestion either.</p>
              <p> well, thanks for reading this, and if you happen to be sick right now, i wish you well.</p>
