              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not too long this time, just discussing some art and other stuff.</p>
              <p> first, been having some more fun with art recently, redoing refsheets and all.</p>
              <p> feel like im going to move away from any icons or stuff like that, as full body peices let me be more creative, i get better practice, and they get more social media attention.</p>
              <p> other than that, gay people stuff. i've been confused over gender stuff for so long, but recently kind of realized non-binary works as a good label. </p>
              <p> it better encapsulates how i feel, and i can get some kind of a discount on car insurance, hehe.</p>
