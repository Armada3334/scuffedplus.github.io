              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!!! new blog post !!! wow so cool </p>
              <p>im doing good good as of recently, no issues at least.</p>
              <p>doing some sillies as of late, vr, creature creation, and some writing.</p>
              <p>going on a cool trip next week, going up to san fransico for a week.</p>
              <p>gonna tour some tech companies and universities, it's via my school, but should be fun.</p>
              <p>besides that, new creature dropped and more super inconsistent art schedule gaming.</p>
              <p>fingers crossed it stays this way but, not really super depressed now!</p>
              <p>anyway, thanks for the read, not like this is formal or anything.</p>
