<p> the past month has been, well, interesting for me. and to preface that would be the reason for 0 posts over that time.</p>
<p> my mental health right now is, interesting, one could say. tough, but im managing. </p>
<p> in other news, twitter may be shitting the bed, so i made a tumblr, and may use that more, given i despise elon musk.</p>
<p> maybe i'll draw more soon, but i've kind of had art block recently. i guess i may aswell post on both platforms now.</p>
