              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wow, new blog post again! well, it's ok because i have something to write about this time!</p>
                <p>lots in fact, to begin and most importantly, im trans! and, well, i if you know me, that isnt news by now, lol.</p>
                <p>looking back retrospectively, it's not that much of a surprise, although it still is major.</p>
                <p>it's a bit stressful, and i've got some stuff ahead of me, but, i can't not at this point.</p>
                <p>dysphoria has been fun, lol. i hope it dosent get any worse.</p>
                <p>looking forward positively, everyone i have spoken too has been very positive about it, which is relieving. </p>
                <p>overall, seems not so bad so far, hope it stays that way. </p>
                  <p></p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;besides that, it turns out not being closeted helps alot with depression.</p>
                <p>i have been able to like, play games, draw, do work, and have social interaction, all in one day!</p>
                <p>despite me still, not really drawing that much recently, i'd like to draw more soon.</p>
                <p>atleast, over the summer, alongside a job, because money is good, and work experience would be cool.</p>
                <p>i've gotten back into well, games again, and playing more VR.</p>
                
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overall, looking fairly good, hope it stays that way.</p>
